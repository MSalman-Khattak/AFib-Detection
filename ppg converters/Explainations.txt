PPG to Respiratory (Multiple Techniuques):
    
    Signal Preprocessing:
        Resampling: The PPG signal is resampled to a higher frequency to enhance the accuracy of peak detection.
        Filtering: A bandpass filter is applied to remove noise and baseline drift from the PPG signal.
    
    Peak Detection:
        Peaks corresponding to respiratory cycles are detected in the filtered PPG signal. This is typically done using peak detection algorithms like find_peaks.
    
    Interval Calculation:
        Time intervals between successive respiratory peaks are computed.
    
    Outlier Removal:
        Outliers in the interval data are removed to improve the accuracy of respiratory rate estimation. This is often done using methods like median absolute deviation (MAD) based outlier detection.
    
    Respiratory Rate Estimation:
        The mean interval between respiratory peaks is calculated, and the respiratory rate is derived from this interval. Typically, respiratory rate is expressed in breaths per minute (BPM).
    
    Interpolation (Optional):
        The respiratory signal can be interpolated to match the original time scale if needed.
